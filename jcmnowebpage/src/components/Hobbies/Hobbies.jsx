        <h2>Travel and Outdoors</h2>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy going on trips and spending time outdoors. 
            I believe it's important to stay active and travel while we are young.
            One of my favorite trips I went on recently is Japan (pictured below). 
            Visit my <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/john_camino/">Instagram</a> to see more trips.

        <h2>Magic the Gathering</h2>
        <p>I enjoy playing trading card game called Magic the Gatherinig.
            It's a fun social activity that I have been actively participating in recently. This game also brings out my
            creativity through deck building. Click <a href = "https://archidekt.com/u/retrospected">here</a> to see the decks I have been brewing up!
